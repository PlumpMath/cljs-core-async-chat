# cljs-core-async-chat

A simple demo using [httpkit][1] and [core.async][2] to build a WebSocket-based, extremely dumb chat system.

The usual caveats in terms of browser-compatibility with WebSocket applies.

Thanks go to David Nolen for his [copious examples][3] of how to use core.async in ClojureScript (and all his work on CLJS and core.async!), as well as random help in IRC when first getting going.

## Todos

* Get core.async working with httpkit on the server side.
* Flesh it out more to really take advantage of core.async.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][4] 1.7.0 or above installed.

## Running

### Compile CLJS

    lein cljsbuild once

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run

Go to localhost:3000.

Easier to see what's going on if you open it on a few different machines on the same network (will need to configure ws-url in base.cljs), or at least a few different browsers on the same machine.
